Linux setup tool.
===========

A tool for creating my linux environment automatically (specifically my Xubuntu 14.04).

__This work is greatly inspired by the [webcoyote](https://github.com/webcoyote/linux-setup) one.__

Installation
===

If you don't have curl yet:

`~$ sudo apt-get install curl -qq -y`

If you already have curl:

`~$ curl -# -o linux-setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelcn/Linux-setup/master/linux-setup.sh`

__That's it, *simple* as that. Now go and setup your linux environment ;)__
